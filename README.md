# CrossOver-Trading-Strategy
This series of applications was written in a proprietary language called EasyLanguage for the trading software Tradestation.  I have also included a number of sample reports for reference.

I did this in my internship at Proquest Technologies back in mid 2015 in order to write a Quantitative Trading Algorithm to test and implement this particular investment strategy for the company.  

This program took about 6 months for me to create, and accomplished the task of processing very large amounts of market data for the purpose of optimizing itself, based on market conditions, the particular asset, and asset class, to produce the maximum alpha (profits) possible.  After the program generated a number of reports and a human reviewed those reports, the program would implement it's newly optimized settings in live market conditions across the top 10 income producing assets all while continually optimizing itself as new market data became available.
